# API for Textbook Summaries

This repository defines the api for our digital textbook project.

Currently, it scores section summaries using a finetuned language model.

# Development

Clone the repository and run `pipenv install` to install requirements from the pipfile. (please note that you will need to manually install NLTK and Huggingface models for the time being.)
